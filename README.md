# Applied-Predictive-Modeling

This is the repo for our solutions to [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/). Max Kuhn, now employed at RStudio, has put out a lot of new tools and packages and we hope to incorporate them as we work through the book.

[Here](https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) is the `caret` package reference book.

## Max Kuhn Packages

1. [`tidyposterior`](https://topepo.github.io/tidyposterior/index.html)
    - Bayesian modeling of RMSE cross-validation statistics, which Kuhn considers an upgrade to the `caret::resamples` function. Works natively with
    
2. [`rsample`](https://topepo.github.io/rsample/index.html)
    - creates a tibble of collections of resamples

3. [`recipes`](https://topepo.github.io/recipes/)
    - This sounds very exciting. The goal is to design a tidy workflow for model building and formula syntax. Works well with `caret` train functions.



## Other References

This is a list of other references I'd like to explore that I feel fit into the machine learning theme of the book. 

1. [Spatial Prediction](https://matthewdharris.com/2016/04/19/predicting-in-feature-space/) at Quantitative Archaeology.
